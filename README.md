# ArduinoExtra

## Setup

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Use the new 2.0.0 version if possible as it is easier to work with.
2. Clone this repository in the User/Documents/Arduino/libraries/ (or equivalent on Mac/Linux) folder.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new project. Write `#include <ArduinoExtra.h>` at the top of the file and press verify to make sure everything is installed properly.
4. Open the cloned repository in VSCode or another text editor/IDE (make sure you don't commit your project files on accident).

**NOTE**: Write all the library code in this folder, but any tests should be done within the Arduino IDE.
